                <h3 class="margin-bottom-25">OUR MISSION IS SIMPLE</h3>
                <p><span class="firstcharacter">L</span>ighthouse is a full service, unique management consulting company which exists to help individuals, teams and organizations to reach their full potential. Our corporate excellence initiatives are implemented through training, coaching, consulting and headhunting. Lighthouse acts as a <span class="alternate-font">'match-making'</span> platform, where a service seeker easily can locate the best service providers in the fastest possible way.</p>
                <p>Lighthouse provides a bridge leading to excellence in both business and technology. Since technology is now the leading cause of <span class="alternate-font">transformation</span> in every aspect of business, it is imperative to approach any opportunity using a technology enable strategy. Regardless of which direction the strategy takes, whether business, technology or operations, it is of utmost importance that we shape the outcome to our high values and one step ahead of the present set threshold.</p>
                <p>To deliver A-rated strategies is our strong suit, and how we provide it to help thousands is not something to be overlooked. We not only provide the hard facts regarding the welfare of your business, but provide a deep insight of the geographical and socioeconomic aspects as well. We work <span class="alternate-font">cohesively and collaboratively,</span> to ensure a lasting partnership that can endure the highs and lows regarding a much coveted start up. Finally, our success is defined by your results. We care deeply for our clients and thoroughly enjoy our work.</p>
                <p>Businesses do not start out bad; businesses fail because of bad strategies. We help clients with the most complex strategic challenges and build solutions tailored to suit the clients’ needs and <span class="alternate-font">emphasize success</span> from the get-go. We ensure our clients know where to execute and invest, thus out-executing and out-investing the potential competitors in the markets, ultimately ensuring highest return values.</p>
                <p>In business, <span class="alternate-font">corporate strategy</span> refers to the overall strategy of an organization that is made up of multiple business units, operating in multiple markets. It determines how the corporation as a whole supports and enhances the value of the business units within it; and it answers the question, "How do we structure the overall business, so that all of its parts create more value together than they would individually?"</p>
                <p>Corporations can do this by building strong internal competences, by sharing technologies and resources between business units, by raising capital cost-effectively, by developing and nurturing a <span class="alternate-font">strong corporate brand,</span> and so on.</p>
                <p>Success in business is determined by the art of allocating scarce resources, and many businesses often struggle with the notion of where to use what. To <span class="alternate-font">triumph,</span> one must unlock full core potential before pursuing adjacencies.</p>
                <p>There is nothing called ‘good, clean business’. Competition and thriving on it, and finally attaining <span class="alternate-font">leadership,</span> will ensure competitive advantage. Finally, it is imperative success and winning strategies are shared with the entire company, and not just hushed around in the board room, to guarantee an upheaval in general confidence.</p>
                <p>Our consultants and facilitators represent a rich <span class="alternate-font">diversity</span> of disciplines and career experiences. They come from a broad range of industries, including, Project Management, Hospitality services, Financial services, Manufacturing, Supply-Chain, Customer Relations, Brand Marketing and HR.</p>
                <p>Unlike others, we have a <span class="alternate-font">constellation of experts</span> who have a unique understanding of each market they serve.</p>
