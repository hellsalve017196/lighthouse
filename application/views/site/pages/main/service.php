                            <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>raining and development -- or "learning and development" as many refer to it now -- is one of the most important aspects of our lives and our work. Many people view "training" as an activity that produces the result or outcome of "learning" -- and learning is typically viewed as new knowledge, skills and competencies or abilities. In our culture, we highly value learning. Yet, despite our having attended many years of schooling, many of us have no idea how to carefully design an approach to training and development.</p>

                            <p>It remains a common belief that the biggest benefit of learning is to get a diploma or a credential, but as one gets older and wiser, he realizes that there are many more benefits to learning than just that. Knowing the core of learning will help motivate one’s design to the training plans and programs, and motivate others to participate as well.</p>

                            <p>There are different, major forms of learning and development, and we are most familiar with formal forms of learning and development that include the strong attention to the systematic structure and evaluation of learning and development, especially as used in schooling. We are also expanding the concept of learning beyond that of just individuals, but introducing the idea that groups and organizations can learn too. Lastly, a training program is an intentionally designed, highly integrated set of activities that are aligned to accomplish a certain criteria of results among learners.</p>

A typical headhunt would involve commissioning an executive search firm to help define and advise on the role to be recruited, pull together a target list of companies (anything from 20 - 50, usually competitors) to headhunt into, identifying people in posts through research, seeking recommendations and tracking high performance individuals.
